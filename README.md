# OWAFull (deprecated)
A Chrome extension which allows Chrome to use the full version of Outlook Web Access, instead of being stuck in the light version (some ActiveX controls may not work).

Install from the Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/owafull/kclknahgladfnmibdkpdeplkbjhkddoe

**Depracation:**

For those wanting to improve this project with new features and updates, I ask that someone fork this project and feel free to release it to the Chrome Extension store as your own. If you do happen to take this and republish it with fixes, feel free to notify the maintainers in an issue and provide links to the new project.
